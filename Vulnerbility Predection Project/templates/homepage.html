            Welcome to the project "Predicting Vulnerability Severity via Boosted Machine Learning." This project focuses on developing a powerful system for predicting the severity of security vulnerabilities using advanced machine learning techniques.
        </p>
        <p>
            In recent years, the number of vulnerabilities discovered and publicly disclosed has shown a sharp upward trend. However, the value of exploiting these vulnerabilities varies for attackers, as only a small fraction of them are actually exploited. Therefore, the project aims to enable quick identification of non-exploitable vulnerabilities and optimal prioritization of limited resources for patching, which is essential for organizations' cybersecurity.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our proposed exploit prediction model, called fastEmbed, harnesses the capabilities of fastText and LightGBM algorithms. This model is designed to outperform baseline models by replicating key aspects of state-of-the-art work in exploit prediction. It offers superior generalization and prediction abilities, making it highly effective in forecasting exploits in real-world scenarios.
        </p>
        <p>
            The project aims to enhance cybersecurity practices, assist organizations in prioritizing vulnerability remediation, and contribute to a safer digital environment for all.
